# Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.

# However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.

# Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[1])





# Since strings are arrays, we can loop through the characters in a string, with a for loop.

for x in "banana":
    print(x)




# To get the length of a string, use the len() function.

b = "Hello, World!"
print(len(b))




# To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in.

txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("free" in txt)

# Use it in an if statement:
if "free" in txt:
    print("Yes, 'free' is present.")





# To check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present in a string, we can use the keyword not in.
print("expensive" not in txt)

# Use it in an if statement:
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
if "expensive" not in txt:
    print("No, 'expensive' is NOT present.")
